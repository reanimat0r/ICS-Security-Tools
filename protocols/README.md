## Ethernet/IP and CIP

- [EtherNet/IP+CIP dissector for Scapy](https://github.com/scy-phy/scapy-cip-enip) - a Python library which can be used to interact with components of a network using ENIP (Ethernet/IP) and CIP (Common Industrial Protocol) protocols. It uses scapy to implement packet dissectors which are able to decode a part of the network traffic. These dissectors can also be used to craft packets, which allows directly communicating with the PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) of the network. [Use case](https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/offensive-ics-exploitation-a-technical-description/)
- [Scapy implementation of DLR (Device Level Ring) protocol](https://github.com/scy-phy/scapy-dlr)

- [CPPPO - Communications Protocol Python Parser and Originator (EtherNet/IP CIP implementation)](https://github.com/pjkundert/cpppo) - Cpppo is used to implement binary communications protocol parsers. The protocol’s communication elements are described in terms of state machines which change state in response to input events, collecting the data and producing output data artifacts.
- [pycomm](https://github.com/ruscito/pycomm) - **pycomm** is a package that includes a collection of modules used to communicate with PLCs. At the moment the first module in the package is **ab_comm**. **ab_comm** is a module that contains a set of classes used to interface Rockwell PLCs using Ethernet/IP protocol. The "clx" class can be used to communicate with Compactlogix, Controllogix PLCs The "slc" can be used to communicate with Micrologix or SLC PLCs
